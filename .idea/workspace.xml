    <list default="true" id="1e595e61-5d04-4475-b95c-6e3fb7e7bf57" name="Changes" comment="Implemented a basic version of the Energizer. The Energizer, unlike most other Towers, has hidden detection capabilities starting at level 0. The Energizer is also capable of extreme amounts of damage and can easily deal with enemies like the NormalTitan. The current implementation of the Energizer is not final and is subject to change. The GameScene class has also been changed as the Waves that spawn now more accurately reflect what a typical round of the finished game may look like.">

The Prohibited annotation is similar to the Specific annotation however specified classes will be unable to access the annotated constructor or method.

    <MESSAGE value="Added a &quot;native&quot; folder to the project. This is where all native C\C++ code will be located. Currently, there is only one C++ source file in this folder. This source file contains the native code for the &quot;getTarget&quot; method in the Enemy class." />
    <MESSAGE value="Updated the project's structure. The header file for the native C++ code is now located within the native folder. It was previously located in the target folder which is ignored by the .gitignore file." />
    <MESSAGE value="Added numerous classes to the project. These classes include the &quot;Enemy&quot; class, &quot;Tower Class&quot;, and a whole variety of other classes. Each new file was previously used in an old Ultimate Tower Defense project and will now be used here. The structure of the folders and packages has been updated and cleaned up. Other features deemed to be useless or ineffective will also be removed in the future." />
    <MESSAGE value="Made a few additional changes to the structure of the various packages within the project. The GreaterThan and LessThan annotations along with their respective exceptions and verifiers have been removed. More classes will likely be cleaned up or removed in the future." />
    <MESSAGE value="Made a few more changes to the structure of the project. Several maven dependencies were removed as they were not actually doing anything useful. The rest of the custom annotation interfaces were also removed as they to were doing nothing. These should be the last of the changes made for the sole purpose of cleaning up the project." />
    <MESSAGE value="Removed a few additional classes that were deemed inherently useless. These classes include the two interfaces Zombie, and Titan. The Boss interface has also been updated to include the 'special' method. This method can be implemented by certain enemies to use a special attack." />
    <MESSAGE value="Began working on the Tower class. The EventHandler interface was also created and is intended to help read specific events such as button presses or clicks." />
    <MESSAGE value="Updated the project structure once again. The 'world' package was removed and the 'scenes' and 'maps' packages were relocated. The Enemies, Towers, and Maps classes were all removed as well. The ArrayLists of active enemies and towers can now simply be found in the Enemy and Tower classes respectively. The MapBuilder interface was also removed because it wasn't entirely necessary." />
    <MESSAGE value="Began implementing Tower attacks. Towers, specifically the Scout, can now be placed wherever the user clicks the screen. Currently, the implemented attack and placement methods are very primitive and will likely be updated continuously in the future." />
    <MESSAGE value="Added JAVADOC and code comments to the remaining methods within the Tower class." />
    <MESSAGE value="Added a variety of sound effects to the game. A few methods and constructors have also been removed from the Enemy and Tower classes as well as a few of the inheritors." />
    <MESSAGE value="Implemented the targeting for the Tower class. Currently, the Tower can either target the first Enemy along a given Path or the last Enemy. In the future, there will be more targeting modes that the Tower can use. These modes will include the 'strongest' and 'weakest' targeting modes. In addition to this, a variety of other classes that will be implemented in the future have been added to the project. These classes include new Towers, the MapBuilder, and the CharacterBuilder class." />
    <MESSAGE value="Fully implemented the Marksman and Gunner towers, each being equipped with their own methods of attack. The 'strongest' and 'weakest' targeting modes for towers have also been fully implemented. The AudioPlayer class has also been added, making it much easier to play both sound effects and music." />
    <MESSAGE value="There was a missed compiler error in the previous commit. That is the only change that has been made." />
    <MESSAGE value="Fixed a bug regarding the 'getTarget' method in the Tower class. Previously, the tower would attempt to target hidden and flying enemies even without having hidden and flying detection capabilities. This would ultimately cause the Tower to get stuck and unable to attack other enemies. The Stealthy zombie has also now been added. It is the first zombie to properly use the hidden Type." />
    <MESSAGE value="Fixed a bug regarding the 'getTarget' method. Previously, it was possible for a ConcurrentModificationException to be thrown which would render the Tower unable to attack any Enemies. That bug has now been fixed." />
    <MESSAGE value="Implemented the LootBox zombies into the game. LootBox zombies are unique in that when are eliminated, they will spawn a random zombie at their Position. Other iterations of the LootBox zombie include the LootBoxTitan which functions almost identically except that LootBoxTitans will spawn titans at their Position instead of zombies. The Zombie, Titan, and Boss annotations have been added as identifiers to clarify which enemies are zombies, titans, or bosses." />
    <MESSAGE value="Fully implemented the GiantTitan and LootBoxTitan. The LootBoxTitan's 'onDeath' event will spawn another Titan at its location. Enemy implementations will slow down going forward and more work will we be done to finish the Tower class and also add new, more powerful Towers." />
    <MESSAGE value="Forgot about another compiler error. The error has been fixed." />
