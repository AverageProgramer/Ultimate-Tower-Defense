    <list default="true" id="1e595e61-5d04-4475-b95c-6e3fb7e7bf57" name="Changes" comment="Fixed the previously mentioned bug. The bug had caused random Enemies to move at significantly slower speeds when spawned than they are supposed to. In addition to fixing that bug, the GameScene class has also been set up to now fit any computer screen. Lastly, in addition to fixing the previously mentioned animation bug, all other animation bugs have been fixed. These bugs include: Enemies getting stuck at spawn, Enemies stopping at various Positions along their set Path, and Enemies moving at slightly different speeds.">

    <MESSAGE value="Fully implemented the Marksman and Gunner towers, each being equipped with their own methods of attack. The 'strongest' and 'weakest' targeting modes for towers have also been fully implemented. The AudioPlayer class has also been added, making it much easier to play both sound effects and music." />
    <MESSAGE value="There was a missed compiler error in the previous commit. That is the only change that has been made." />
    <MESSAGE value="Fixed a bug regarding the 'getTarget' method in the Tower class. Previously, the tower would attempt to target hidden and flying enemies even without having hidden and flying detection capabilities. This would ultimately cause the Tower to get stuck and unable to attack other enemies. The Stealthy zombie has also now been added. It is the first zombie to properly use the hidden Type." />
    <MESSAGE value="Fixed a bug regarding the 'getTarget' method. Previously, it was possible for a ConcurrentModificationException to be thrown which would render the Tower unable to attack any Enemies. That bug has now been fixed." />
    <MESSAGE value="Implemented the LootBox zombies into the game. LootBox zombies are unique in that when are eliminated, they will spawn a random zombie at their Position. Other iterations of the LootBox zombie include the LootBoxTitan which functions almost identically except that LootBoxTitans will spawn titans at their Position instead of zombies. The Zombie, Titan, and Boss annotations have been added as identifiers to clarify which enemies are zombies, titans, or bosses." />
    <MESSAGE value="Fully implemented the GiantTitan and LootBoxTitan. The LootBoxTitan's 'onDeath' event will spawn another Titan at its location. Enemy implementations will slow down going forward and more work will we be done to finish the Tower class and also add new, more powerful Towers." />
    <MESSAGE value="Forgot about another compiler error. The error has been fixed." />
    <MESSAGE value="Re-implemented a variety of useful tools that had been previously removed. These tools include the Specific and Prohibited annotations as well as the newly implemented Property annotation. The Specific annotation allows an annotated method or constructor to specify which classes can access that constructor or method. The Prohibited annotation is similar to the Specific annotation however specified classes will be unable to access the annotated constructor or method. The Property annotation indicates that an annotated field is a property of a class." />
    <MESSAGE value="Fully re-implemented the tools from the previous commit. These tools include the Specific and Prohibited annotations as well as the LogManager class. The Property annotation has also been implemented and indicates that an annotated field is an inherent property of a class." />
    <MESSAGE value="Implemented Tower and Enemy ranges into the game. Towers can no longer continue to attack enemies even when they are halfway across the Player's screen. Enemy ranges, while implemented, do not currently do anything as Enemy attacks have not yet been implemented. New towers and enemy attacks will be implemented in the near future." />
    <MESSAGE value="Once again removed a variety of tools that just wound up doing more harm than good. These tools include the Specific and Prohibited annotations as well as their verification classes, SpecificAnnotation and ProhibitedAnnotation. The verification was causing noticeable levels of lag and has thus been removed." />
    <MESSAGE value="Fixed a missed compiler error in the module-info file." />
    <MESSAGE value="Implemented a basic version of the Energizer. The Energizer, unlike most other Towers, has hidden detection capabilities starting at level 0. The Energizer is also capable of extreme amounts of damage and can easily deal with enemies like the NormalTitan. The current implementation of the Energizer is not final and is subject to change. The GameScene class has also been changed as the Waves that spawn now more accurately reflect what a typical round of the finished game may look like." />
    <MESSAGE value="Added the Pyromancer to the game. The Pyromancer is unique in that it has no base damage but can burn Enemies. When an Enemy is burned, it will move slower and take a set amount of damage every second. In the future, when Tower upgrades are implemented, the time an Enemy may remain burned will increase along with the burn damage." />
    <MESSAGE value="Implemented the most basic version of the final game. Currently, the player is able to do everything that will be available in the final game except tower upgrades. More enemies and towers will be added in the next commit." />
    <MESSAGE value="Implemented the Summoner and Armored zombies into the game. The Summoner zombies have the ability to spawn 5 random Enemies every 15 seconds. The Armored zombies are the first Enemies to use a 'shield'. Shields can only be damaged if enough damage is actually dealt to the Enemy. For example, if an Enemy has 20 base HP and 15 shield, a Tower can only begin to wear down the Shield if the Tower does a minimum of 5 damage. More Towers will be added in the next commit." />
    <MESSAGE value="Made an update to the LootBox zombie. The LootBox zombie will no longer grant money when damaged. The Summoner has also been renamed to the Sorcerer." />
    <MESSAGE value="Reworked the Energizer. The Energizer will now attack an Enemy until that Enemy has been eliminated. The Sorcerer has also been reworked. Instead of using a completely separate thread to spawn Enemies, the Sorcerer now uses the Enemy attack thread. The Bolt Enemy has also been implemented." />
    <MESSAGE value="Fixed the Wave structure in the GameScene class. Also added Waves 25 and 26 to Easy mode." />
    <MESSAGE value="Added a Wave counter to the GameScene class. Also fixed an issue with the Marksman, Gunner, and Pyromancer Towers. These Towers had not previously set their starting health to 0. This would cause them to get instantly eliminated by Soldier Enemies." />
    <MESSAGE value="Fixed an issue with the Sorcerer where it would spawn Enemies even after it was eliminated." />
    <MESSAGE value="Re-fixed the issue regarding the Sorcerer. The previous commit did not actually address the issue." />
    <MESSAGE value="Implemented the Gunship and Shotgunner Towers into the game. The Shotgunner functions almost identically to every other Tower other than it has a rather slow long cool down but does decent damage. The Gunship is unique as it completes circular paths for an indefinite amount of time and attacks any Enemies that wind up underneath it. The OilRig class has also been added to the game. The OilRig is meant to be the legendary version of the Farm. The OilRig will generate money at a constant rate instead of at the start of every wave." />
    <MESSAGE value="Game is currently bugged. This commit is just to test whether the bug is a hardware issue." />
    <MESSAGE value="Fixed the previously mentioned bug. The bug had caused random Enemies to move at significantly slower speeds when spawned than they are supposed to.
